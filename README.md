# Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
The dataset consists of grayscale images of 10 different types of clothing, such as shoes, shirts, and bags.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to explore deep learning techniques for image classification. I use the Fashion MNIST 
dataset as a benchmark and build a neural network using TensorFlow. The project includes data preprocessing, 
model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation.
- `models/`: Stores trained models and checkpoints.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies for the project.

## Installation
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hazim-T/Fashion-MNIST.git
cd fashion-mnist
pip install -r requirements.txt
